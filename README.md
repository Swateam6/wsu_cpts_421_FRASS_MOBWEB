# Serviak-FRASS
This codebase is the source code repository for the FRASS system. This codebase is only to be used by Dr. Bill and the related capstone teams affiliated with him.

## Project Summary

The Forest Resource Analysis System Software (FRASS) is an internet-accessible Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) program identifying financially optimal timber harvest rotation timing and asset value. This Highest and Best Use (HBU) solution gives landowners and resource managers an Income Capitalization Approach asset value. Here we detail how to realize this value with harvest timing for each timber stand; now and into perpetuity. This software solution presents a reliable and efficient system for scheduling economically optimal forest management activities. We do this while determining the value of timberland properties – one timber stand at a time. In FRASS, tree growth data is combined with detailed information about the parcel. This engages delivered log market data predictions to give financially optimal timber harvest rotation dates and values into the future.

## Git Rules and Way to Work

For new capstone teams, please fork this repository. When forking, make sure to include all branches as there is a Resources branch where we suggest putting your own resources, homework, minutes of meetings, and other items only relevant for the class. Do all your relevant work on that repository on the virtual machine that you will have set up.

When you are done with a feature that Dr. Bill is ready for you to publish to the production site:
1. Create a PR request from your fork to this repo
2. Review
3. Push PR
4. Go into Serviak and pull from TODO: INSERT PATH HERE
5. Publish to the Sandbox for Dr. Bill to double check (See below for instructions on how to)
6. Publish to the main site (See below for instructions on how to)
