				<img src="/Content/images/Finland_Forest1.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;" />This program delivers a single encompassing package of financially optimal forestland analysis. It combines physical site characteristics, regulatory constraints, macro- and micro-economic trends of the marketing areas, and financial recovery options based on Growth & Yield projections for each timber stand on each parcel. Deriving the value of forestland into perpetuity has been possible since the Soil Expectation Value (SEV) was first generated by the German forester Martin Faustmann in 1849 to explain multiple-rotation forestland discounted value.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
				Recent advances in technology have diminished the value of traditional tools in their meaningful application to the tasks of today’s forestland management. In its new approach FRASS incorporates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometric" target="_econometric">econometric tools</a> of Real Price Appreciation predictions, operations research optimization (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_optimization" target="_Linear">nonlinear optimization</a> & <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_quadratic_programming" target="_SQP">sequential quadratic programming</a>), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospatial_analysis" target="_GIS">geospatial analysis</a> techniques.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; ">
				Financial analysis designs practiced earlier for this purpose have proved insufficient in the current economic realities of delivered log markets. Real Price Appreciation techniques need to be applied for understanding the actual (not illusory) trends occurring in today’s economy.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
				FRASS is introduced in response to the need for change by providing forestland managers with new tools to apply to more profitable timberland management.

			Traditional Forest Valuation Approach
		</div>
		<div class="blockItem">
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				Traditional approaches to forest valuation often misstate the Net Present Value of forestland resources based on simplistic interpretations of the Income Capitalization Approach. One of them involves timberland value estimates made for current standing timber, which are then supported with a Faustmann Formula Value in order to claim Income Capitalization Approach to property value. These traditional valuation estimates prove to be inconsistent with their REAL value.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				In recent decades, the estimation of forestland property value has migrated to a progressively higher level of assessment of individual timber stands due to forest Growth & Yield modeling efforts. These fundamental timber resource data enable us to determine tree growth over time. Today, advances in Growth & Yield software programming reveal how the biological resource performs within a set of qualifying parameters of Site Index, precipitation, temperature, and multi-layered timber stand density factors by different tree species comingled on the same property. An ability to grow virtual forests into the future has become a powerful tool vital for an accurate asset valuation. However, attempts at optimization of potential timber harvest, based only on its biological maturity, limits us in the entirety of other possible solutions, totally excluding from consideration financial criteria of the issue.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				The existing software designs for forest Growth & Yield assessments have been augmented with valuation modules – however, <strong>these generally give inadequate optimal valuation estimates</strong>. Why? Read on…
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				In financially optimal timber harvest solutions, some applications evaluate the current timber harvest rotation without considering the next rotation, or each subsequent rotation after that. To further complicate the situation, Delivered Log Market Real Price Appreciation (and Devaluation) phenomenon has not been appreciated and applied in a temporal sense (time effect) to match value parameters of forest growth over time. The general result has been to limit the current timber stand to a financially optimal single-rotation length only, giving no consideration to the discounted value of the next rotation, or rotations into perpetuity.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				<div class="infoText" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-top: 10px; border: solid 1px black; background-color: #cccccc; font-weight: bold; ">
					<div style="padding: 5px; margin: 5px;">
						Before you can plant the next rotation, you must first harvest the current one.
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				As simplistic as this statement sounds, it is almost universally ignored by forest analysts when they attempt to determine financially optimal timber rotation lengths for each timber stand into perpetuity. The approach offered in FRASS calls for a broader perception of timberland value. In constantly shifting log markets a balance needs to be found between biological maturity of the timber asset extending into its future growth, and the financially optimal solution matching it. This new power joining the two worlds gives the analyst and landowner an unprecedented ability to find the best combination of both.

			The FRASS Forest Valuation Approach
		</div>
		<div class="blockItem">
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				FRASS uses data collected by forestland managers for their properties. Some of these data are publicly available while other data are generated. We recognize the importance of these data for managing the property and their impacts on the value of the resource.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				At the very core of data analysis rests a 3-legged stool of 1) geospatial data (commonly just called GIS data), 2) Forest Growth & Yield data, and 3) economic data. Other information are transcribed into one or all of these formats; everything is summarized into maps and tabular data.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="blockItem">
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				<strong>GIS DATA</strong>
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				GIS data are stored in the program’s databases as a combination of spatial and tabular layers. A map allows you to visualize spatial relationships within an intermix of physical land resource characteristics that need to be seen and interpreted within a specific context. A map gives you quick recognition of, say, the cost of building a new road, when neighboring properties do not have roads, or the placement of a log landing in response to limiting soil characteristics. <strong>We treat a map as a visual data representation.</strong>
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				Tabular parcel data provide mountains of information that need to be put into an easy-to-digest format for their meaningful application. Spatial data have been translated into tables for each parcel separately to summarize its variable attributes (e.g., soil sensitivity, site index, slope, elevation) and its total area (acres, hectares) or length (stream length, road length, etc.). These values are compressed into content-charged data packages for the practical implementation by a landowner or manager alike. By summarizing these data blocks for each parcel and timber stand, we create easy-to-understand tools for highly specified analytical solutions.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				<img src="/Content/images/Forest_Roads1.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />One example of the advances in derived GIS data analysis comes from combining accurate elevation and topography data in the form of Digital Elevation Models (DEM). Although the science of land topography excelled to cover much of North America with 10 meter DEM, LiDAR flights have the ability to display these same areas at 1 meter resolution: a higher level of precision for analysis.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				For instance, we have been able to map roads by using 1 meter resolution LiDAR relief maps to pinpoint road boundaries. Although we map roads as lines, they represent a polygon of area that is not otherwise available for growing trees – <strong>they represent non-operable lands</strong>.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				To take the roads example further, we have developed a technique to use the LiDAR-generated topographic models to calculate the actual surface lengths of roads on each timber stand and each parcel. When you look at an area’s map, roads are viewed as “flat” lines without any reference to their surface inclines; the lengths of the roads are typically displayed as “two-dimensional” distances (horizontal lines). However, in reality the roads cross rivers, and meander to make a ‘switch-back’ as they climb a hill, and cross elevation changes – they travel up and down hills since we exist in a three-dimensional reality. To account for these topographic features, we created a solution allowing you to determine the actual road length on each parcel and timber stand. These dimensionally enhanced distance solutions make it easier to calculate more accurately log hauling costs and road maintenance costs based on timber volume removed, also and actual log hauling distances on each category of road.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				A buffer around each road is determined to account for non-operable land, which is not available for growing timber: those areas are removed from the productive timberland base.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				<img src="/Content/images/Stream_1.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;" />We use a similar approach when dealing with streams as they cross through a timber stand and a parcel area. Streams represent a complex meandering grid of aquatic flows of certain width. As an open road is associated with a physical removal of timber growing lands, so do segments of the stream network – trees do not grow in a river.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				We define the stream network within a) an active channel, b) aquatic land, c) floodplain, and d) riparian zone; each segment increasingly broader than the previous, with a riparian zone often defined administratively, which makes its relative width to the other segments ambiguous. The active channel and aquatic lands (a) and b) - both represent property excluded from growing commercial timber and both support an active aquatic process. These segments are mapped but not included in the operable timber growing lands of each timber stand.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				The riparian zone is often described administratively (by state/province or federal regulations) to remove the trees from commercial harvest. Depending on the interpretation of riparian zone’s administrative limitations, the lands may be completely removed from timber production or be detained from even-aged management techniques in favor of a single-tree removal and green-tree retention strategies to achieve a prescribed tree density for the dependent stream. Over time, the riparian zone trees may be available for harvest through uneven-aged management techniques. It is critical to precisely identify the area and location of aquatic zones for sustaining a forested wildlife habitat. Maintaining an active forest Growth & Yield profile for those lands is important for articulating the wildlife habitat maintained and the merchandized timber characteristics through time.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				All physical site characteristics are determined and promoted to a parcel analysis phase in a mapping format and as tabular summaries.

			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				<strong>GROWTH & YIELD DATA</strong>
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				The process of estimating forest growth over time has climbed to an unprecedented level of accuracy with expanding computing power allowing for the creation of large databases by expert biometricians who are able to incorporate relevant data characteristics from timber stand inventories to grow virtual forests.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				These systems can generate species/sort volumes by periodic year intervals (e.g., every 5 years) combined with additional measurements such as carbon sequestered, shade generated for the understory, specific wildlife habitat generated, and more.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-top: 10px; border: solid 1px black; background-color: #cccccc; font-weight: bold; ">
				<div style="padding: 5px; margin: 5px;">
					FRASS does not replace forest inventory data processing programs used by the forestland manager; it augments them into a truly powerful financial analysis database.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				Forestland managers need a well-defined forest Growth & Yield program to support the additional tools of the FRASS approach - such as area determination in GIS for each timber stand - to be combined into the basic building blocks of the financial analysis system.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				<img src="/Content/images/logdeck_Sndpt.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />Some log market areas use timber species groups purchased in sorts (e.g., Export 12”+, Export 8-12”, 2 Sawmill, 3 Sawmill, 4 Sawmill, pulp). The forestland manager will specify sorts from each species group, and place them into the growth model to merchandize each log from future potential harvest events. FRASS incorporates the findings into the financial projections for each timber stand by matching the expected volume with the forecasted price.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				Other marketing areas purchase species-group logs under a camprun market area format: the log buyers negotiate a price by species group (e.g., Douglas-fir/Larch) to determine the log price for all logs from that group. Most of these market areas report a range of prices (max – min) with log buyers having a lot of “wiggle space” to negotiate prices based on the physical characteristics of the timber sale’s logs. Reliable forest Growth & Yield programs are tailored to reflect the migration of species’ logs into each incremental change in value.
			</div>
			<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
				FRASS maintains a robust economic package of existing timber prices in each market area expressed in nominal terms; combined with macroeconomic data the program brings unquestionable financial benefits of the well-functioning forest Growth & Yield model.

			<strong>ECONOMIC DATA</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
			FRASS merges forest physical site characteristics and forest Growth & Yield data into a financial optimization package unparalleled in the forest industry. Supported with sound econometric projections it allows you to recognize market behavior: long-term trends as different from short-term market shocks. It introduces the Real Price Appreciation as an expression of economic life events to form actual price curves versus illusory trends of Nominal Prices.
		</div>
		<div class="infoText" style="padding-top: 10px;">
		</div>
		<div class="infoText" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
			<img src="/Content/images/RPA_price_shocks400.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;" />FRASS is built around economic variables pulled from a variety of sources resulting in the data interpretation through understanding real-time price formation events, extremely sensitive to factors of time and location. Grasping the phenomenon of Real Price Behavior actualizing itself in time enables managers to view a resulting curve formation and feel through it a financial “pulse” of their markets. Equally important in this context becomes an acquired ability to respond to “pros and cons” of any time-specific change in a trend in concurrence with its newly appreciated financially optimal benefits.

			Much of what has been shared here implies the utilization of traditional data, sometimes analyzed at a new angle, or modeled through advanced biometric models. FRASS in its design in a comprehensive way satisfies both the office-tethered desktop user and the mobile device client, and achieves new insights by filtering the data through advanced econometric tools of delivered log market Real Price Appreciation, accurate Real and Nominal price treatment, and sequential quadratic programming optimization. <strong>The FRASS program, when integrated into your management design, will increase your long-term profitability.</strong>
