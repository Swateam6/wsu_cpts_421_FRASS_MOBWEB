			Forest Resource Analysis System Software (FRASS) integrates Forest Econometrics data with our Client’s physical resource data. <strong>The goal is to contextually amplify the existing data through structurally built interrelations within the software system leading to financially optimal harvest timing solutions on all timber stands and into perpetuity.</strong>

			Timber log markets often operate with specific log sorts, such as 2 Sawmill, 3 Sawmill, pulp, etc., which makes it a desirable recommendation to integrate within the Client’s  data a forest Growth & Yield program capable of merchandizing the trees into logs so that volume can be defined by sorts. We have released within FRASS an econometric system oriented for specific log market areas with historic price information; combined with the system’s design, we make it possible to develop realistic timber price predictions that are matched with detailed forest Growth & Yield data over time.

			The built-in architecture of multiple data layers allows users through a system of intuitive operations to identify the economically optimal harvest rotation timing for each timber stand, in the current and all future rotations. Using sequential quadratic programming techniques, the program aggregates anticipated log sort volumes for each species, at each possible rotation combination, to assess the expected volumes and financial values for the mix of products anticipated at each harvest entry.

			The diagram below is a schematic representation of several diverse data blocks built into a circular shape, having as its core our Client’s Data complemented by Modified and Created Data from a mix of sources; the next level involves Econometric Data and analysis techniques wrapped around the previous two layers and ultimately placed within a single shell of security encryptions and reporting protocols.  The graphic shown here “Forest Resource Analysis System Software Data Design” visually identifies data segments separating the Client’s Confidential Data, Mixed Source Data, and Forest Econometrics’ Data and Programming.
